This project is a fully functional **multiplayer Tic Tac Toe game** built with **Unity** using **Netcode for GameObjects**, **Unity Lobby**, and **Relay services**. It demonstrates how to implement real-time multiplayer features like matchmaking, turn-based logic, synced scores, sound effects, and rematches — all using Unity’s official networking stack.

## 🧠 Learning Focus

This project was built for **educational purposes** — to demonstrate how small-scale multiplayer games can be prototyped in Unity using modern networking tools, without relying on third-party plugins.
